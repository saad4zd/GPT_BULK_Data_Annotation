# Data Annotation with GPT and BULK

This repository contains code and resources for data annotation using both the GPT Language Model and BULK annotation tools.

## Dataset

The dataset "Corona_NLP_test.csv" is included in this repository. It consists of tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with their sentiment labels. You can find the original dataset on Kaggle: [Corona_NLP_test.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ludovicocuoghi/twitter-sentiment-analysis-with-bert-vs-roberta/input)

## Files

- `GPT_Annotation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for annotating the dataset using the GPT Language Model.
- `BULK_Annotation.py`: Python script for performing bulk data annotation using BULK annotation tools.
- `gpt-annotations.csv`: Output file containing the annotated dataset with sentiment labels generated by both GPT and BULK.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Umap learn
- Sentence Transformers

## Instructions
